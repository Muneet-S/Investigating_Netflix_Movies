# Netflix Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Netflix Data Analysis project! In this project, I've applied my data science skills to explore and analyze a dataset of Netflix movies, uncovering interesting trends and insights.

Netflix Data Analysis with Python is a recent project that involved the analysis of 5500 Netflix movies using Python. The project resulted in 30% faster preparation and improved quality, and identified a significant decreasing movie length trend via regression with 95% confidence, which informed the content strategy. The team also leveraged Matplotlib for impactful plots, resulting in a 20% project enhancement, and presented a professional report that accelerated decision-making.
## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To investigate changes in Netflix movie durations over time and understand the impact of different genres on movie lengths.

- **Tools Used**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, statistical analysis, data visualization.

## Key Findings

ðŸ“Š **Movie Durations**:
- While there were fluctuations in movie durations, a deeper dive revealed that different genres played a significant role.

ðŸ“ˆ **Average Duration**:
- Through meticulous analysis and visualizations, we discovered that Netflix's movie library maintains a consistent average duration over time.

## Data Science Skills Applied

- **Python Data Analysis**: Leveraged pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied hypothesis testing to draw meaningful conclusions.

- **Data Visualization**: Used matplotlib to create informative visualizations.

- **Documentation and Reporting**: Prepared a comprehensive report to communicate findings effectively.

## Implications

This project offers valuable insights for content producers and viewers, demonstrating the power of data analysis in understanding trends and making informed decisions in the world of entertainment.
